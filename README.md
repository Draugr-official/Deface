# Deface
Deface is a compiler directed towards compiling C# to machine code. This compiler contains a code analysis API which can be easily accessed, learned and used.

## Features
Deface is packed with utilities and features ready for you to use. A speedy AST generator alongside great code generation will result in greatly optimized output and short compilation times, even for bigger solutions. We are looking for new ways to optimize and generate code continously as we develop this compiler.

## Development
Deface is in its early-mid development stages, allowing for suggestions and contribution to the project. Issue a request if you have ideas for changes to this compiler.
